# A novel machine learning approach for detecting events from social media platform - Twitter
During my undergraduation final year design project/thesis work, I (with my group) have implemented this system that can detect events from social media dataset. This is a novel machine learning approach for detecting events from social media.
First, the pre-trained BERT (proposed by Google) classification model is trained and evaluated with a labeled dataset created from the tweets of some renowned news pages. News data from BBC, CNN, Al-Jazeera, Reuters have been choosen for detecting events.
